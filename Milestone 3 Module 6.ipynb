    "Question 1: What is Logistic Regression, and how does it differ from Linear\n",
    "Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for classification problems (e.g., predicting whether something is \"yes/no\", \"spam/not spam\"). It models the probability of an outcome using the sigmoid (logistic) function, which maps values to a range between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference from Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression predicts a continuous value (e.g., house price).\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression predicts a probability of a categorical outcome, usually binary (0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: Explain the role of the Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression converts the linear combination of input features (which can range from \n",
    "−∞ to +∞) into a value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: \n",
    "\n",
    "σ(z) = 1 / (1+e^z)\n",
    "\n",
    "It maps the output to a probability, which helps decide the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If probability ≥ 0.5 → class 1\n",
    "\n",
    "If probability < 0.5 → class 0\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: What is Regularization in Logistic Regression and why is it needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization in Logistic Regression is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging the model from assigning too much importance (large coefficients) to any feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 (Lasso): Encourages sparsity, some coefficients become zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 (Ridge): Shrinks coefficients but keeps them small and non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevents overfitting on training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improves generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helps handle multicollinearity among features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4: What are some common evaluation metrics for classification models, and\n",
    "why are they important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Common evaluation metrics for classification models:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy: Proportion of correctly predicted instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision: Out of predicted positives, how many are actually positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall (Sensitivity): Out of actual positives, how many are correctly identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "F1-Score: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, balances both.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROC-AUC: Measures model’s ability to distinguish between classes across thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusion Matrix: Summarizes TP, FP, TN, FN for deeper error analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance:\n",
    "They give a complete picture of model performance, especially in imbalanced datasets where accuracy alone can be misleading.\n",
